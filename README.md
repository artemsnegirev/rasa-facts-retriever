# Rasa task-oriented example

## Description

This bot is an example of task-oriented bot that developed with Rasa framework. Bot can retrieve intresting facts according to topic (e.g. about human or animals). Database was handcrafted and stores facts as key-value at `fake_db.json`. Bot requires topic using so called slot-filling (or form-filling) mechanism. To collect topic NLU uses lookup tables (rule based approach), but intent recognition solved by pretrained transformer LM and DIET on top it (machine learning approcah).
